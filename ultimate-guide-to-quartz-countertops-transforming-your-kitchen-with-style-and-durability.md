## **What Are Quartz Countertops?**

Quartz countertops are engineered surfaces made from natural quartz crystals
combined with resins and pigments. Unlike natural stone like granite or
marble, quartz countertops are manufactured through a high-tech process that
results in a highly uniform and customizable surface.

In terms of appearance and feel, quartz countertops mimic the luxury of
natural stone but provide additional durability and ease of maintenance. For
homeowners in Lauderhill, FL, and surrounding neighborhoods like North
Lauderdale and Margate, quartz offers a reliable and aesthetically pleasing
option that withstands the rigors of daily life.

## **Why Choose Quartz Countertops?**

When weighing your options, why do so many homeowners opt for quartz? Here are
some compelling reasons:

Quartz is incredibly hard, ranking 7 out of 10 on the Mohs scale, making it
resistant to scratches and chips—ideal for busy kitchens in Tamarac and
Oakland Park.

Unlike natural stones that require sealing, quartz surfaces are non-porous.
This means they resist stains, mold, and bacteria, making cleaning a breeze.

### **Aesthetic Versatility**

From classic whites to vibrant hues, quartz countertops come in a plethora of
colors and patterns, enabling color-coordinated designs that suit any style.

### **Consistent Patterns**

Because they are engineered, quartz slabs exhibit uniform patterns and colors,
eliminating the unpredictability seen with natural stones.
