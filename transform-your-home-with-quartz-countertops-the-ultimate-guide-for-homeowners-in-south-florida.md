## **What Are Quartz Countertops? An Overview**

### **Understanding Quartz as a Material**

Quartz countertops are engineered surfaces made from crushed natural quartz
combined with resin binders and pigments. This combination results in a
material that boasts remarkable strength, resilience, and beauty. Unlike
natural stone, which can be porous and prone to staining, quartz countertops
are non-porous and resistant to scratches and stains.

### **Why Choose Quartz Countertops? The Benefits**

  * **Durability:** Quartz is one of the hardest materials used in home surfaces, making it ideal for busy kitchens.
  * **Low Maintenance:** No sealing required—simply clean with mild soap and water.
  * **Design Versatility:** Available in a broad spectrum of colors and styles, including popular _white quartz countertops_.
  * **Hygienic Surface:** Non-porous surface resists mold, bacteria, and mildew.

## **Popular Quartz Countertop Colors and Styles**

### **White Quartz Countertops – Brighten Your Kitchen**

light and work well with various cabinet finishes and flooring styles. Whether
you want a sleek modern look or a classic design, white quartz adds a clean
and spacious feel.

### **A Palette of Quartz Countertops Colors**

Besides white, quartz countertops come in myriad colors:
