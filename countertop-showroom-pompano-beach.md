## **Why Visiting a Countertop Showroom Matters**

Online photos are helpful… but they’re also sneaky. Lighting, filters, and
tiny samples can make one slab look like ten different stones.

### **You Need to See the Full Pattern**

Countertops are big surfaces. A small sample can’t show the movement, veining,
and natural variation across an entire slab.

### **You Can Feel the Finish**

Polished, honed, textured—each finish has a different vibe. When you touch the
surface in person, the right choice becomes obvious.

#### **The “Kitchen Island Test”**

If you can picture your island stealing the spotlight at a party, you’re on
the right track.
