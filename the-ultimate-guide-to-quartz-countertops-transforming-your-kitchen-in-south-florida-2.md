## **What Are Quartz Countertops?**

consistent color and pattern, making them a favorite among homeowners.

Are you tired of inconsistent patterns and maintenance hassles? Think of
quartz countertops as the high-performance sports car of kitchen surfaces.
They combine aesthetic appeal with practical advantages, providing you with a
